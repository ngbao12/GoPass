            "content": "<p class=\"mb-4 text-justify\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, from healthcare to education. However, as AI technologies advance, the risk of AI abuse also increases. AI abuse refers to the misuse of AI systems to harm individuals or manipulate society. Common forms include deep fake videos, where faces and voices are digitally altered to create fake content, and data manipulation, which involves AI algorithms influencing public opinion through misleading information. <b>AI abuse is a growing concern as these systems become  more accessible, raising ethical and safety issues for individuals and societies alike. </b></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-justify\"><b>[I]</b> One example of AI abuse is in social media, where AI-driven bots spread false information.<b> [II] </b> These bots, designed to imitate real users, can post, comment, and interact with others, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake content. <b>[III]</b> As a result, <b>they</b> can change opinions on political and social issues, sometimes with harmful consequences. The speed at which these bots operate allows misinformation to spread rapidly, posing challenges for fact-checkers and social media platforms in controlling false narratives. <b>[IV] </b></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-justify\">Another area where AI abuse has gained attention is privacy invasion. Facial recognition technology, for example, is often used by authorities for security. However, some private organisations use it without consent, tracking individuals in public spaces and selling the information to advertisers. This practice violates personal privacy and has <b>sparked a debate about</b> the ethical use of AI.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-justify\">To combat AI abuse, experts suggest stricter regulations and improved awareness. Laws need to address emerging technologies and prevent the misuse of AI systems. Additionally, educating the public on identifying AI-generated content can <b>empower</b> individuals to navigate the digital world safely. As AI continues to evolve, establishing clear ethical guidelines will be essential to prevent its harmful uses and to ensure that AI remains a tool for positive change.</p>"

But how can people recognize they are in danger? Scientists use many methods to help predict when natural hazards are likely to happen.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-justify\">Seismometers measure earthquake activity. An increase in small earthquakes can mean a larger earthquake is about to happen or a volcano is becoming more active. If a volcanic eruption is predicted, people can <b>evacuate</b>, or move to safer areas. Governments can prepare emergency supplies, such as food and water. Emergency workers can be ready to help with injuries. All of these steps reduce the impact and help save lives.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-justify\">Scientists use several devices and methods to constantly collect information about a volcano’s activity. Radio transmissions allow the data to be sent instantly to a monitoring system. Scientists can tell what is happening with a volcano almost as soon as it happens. They can also use that information to predict what is likely to happen next.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4 text-justify\">Besides tracking seismic activity, scientists also monitor gases, temperature and water at a volcano site. A change in the amount of carbon dioxide and others given off by the volcano can be measured to comprehensive analysis of these factors help scientists improve eruption predictions and enhance public safety.</p>"
